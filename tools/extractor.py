    """Extract image patch from bounding box.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : ndarray
        The full image.
    bbox : array_like
        The bounding box in format (x, y, width, height).
    patch_shape : Optional[array_like]
        This parameter can be used to enforce a desired patch shape
        (height, width). First, the `bbox` is adapted to the aspect ratio
        of the patch shape, then it is clipped at the image boundaries.
        If None, the shape is computed from :arg:`bbox`.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray | NoneType
        An image patch showing the :arg:`bbox`, optionally reshaped to
        :arg:`patch_shape`.
        Returns None if the bounding box is empty or fully outside of the image
        boundaries.
